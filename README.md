# Hey there, I’m Natasha 💫

> “Code is my canvas. Logic is my paint. Let’s build something beautiful.”

🎓 Currently crafting my path as a **Software Engineer**, one line of code at a time.

🎮 After hours? You’ll catch me:
- Modding my favorite games (yes, I break them just to rebuild them better 😌)

## 💻 What I’m Up To

Right now, I’m in deep with:

- Frontend and backend **web development**
- Writing clean Python scripts that *just work™*
- Diving into **game dev**, because why just play games when you can create them?

### ✨ Fun Fact
Sometimes I write code like it’s poetry — because bugs fear elegance.
